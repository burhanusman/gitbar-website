# GitBar Website

macOS menu bar app for tracking git repositories with AI project detection (Claude Code, Codex).

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Three.js / React Three Fiber for 3D graphics
- Lucide icons

## Design Context

### Users
Developers who use AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex) and need to track changes across multiple repositories. They're technically savvy, appreciate good design, and spend their days in terminals and IDEs. They discover tools through GitHub, Twitter, and developer communities.

### Brand Personality
**Cyberpunk, Edgy, Expressive**

GitBar doesn't play it safe. The brand leans hard into retro-futurism—CRT aesthetics, neon glows, and terminal culture. It's a tool made by developers who care about craft and aren't afraid to have a strong visual point of view.

### Aesthetic Direction
**Blade Runner / Tron visual language:**
- Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0c) with high-contrast neon accents
- Primary cyan (#00f5d4) with amber (#ffbe0b) and hot pink (#ff006e) supporting
- Scanlines, perspective grids, CRT glow effects
- Monospace typography (JetBrains Mono) paired with geometric display (Space Grotesk)
- Terminal-inspired UI patterns, bracket motifs `[GITBAR]`
- Purposeful glitch and flicker animations

**Anti-references (explicitly avoid):**
- Generic SaaS landing pages with gradient blobs
- Corporate, stiff, enterprise aesthetics
- Cookie-cutter startup templates

### Emotional Goals
Users should feel:
1. "This is cool as hell" — impressed, want to share it, memorable
2. "I need this now" — urgency, excitement, immediate desire to download

### Design Principles

1. **Commit to the aesthetic** — Don't half-ass the retro-futurism. If there's a scanline effect, make it purposeful. If there's a glow, make it dramatic. The whole site should feel like a cohesive visual experience, not a template with effects sprinkled on.

2. **Terminal is home** — This is a developer tool. Embrace monospace, command-line patterns, and the visual language developers live in. The terminal block, bracket motifs, and code-style typography aren't decoration—they're identity.

3. **Contrast creates drama** — Use the dark background as negative space. Let the cyan neon pop. Don't muddy the palette with too many colors. High contrast, intentional hierarchy.

4. **Motion with purpose** — Animations should feel like system boot-up, data streaming, or interface loading. Flicker sparingly. Glitch on hover. Everything should reinforce the cyberpunk machine aesthetic.

5. **Respect the craft** — Every detail matters. Pixel-perfect alignment, consistent spacing, thoughtful micro-interactions. The site should feel as polished as the app it's selling.
